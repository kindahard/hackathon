### 💡 Pro-Tip for the Event

Since you are dealing with **Selenium** and **SQL**, create a folder on your desktop named `Hackathon_Workspace` now. Inside it, create:

1. `data/` (for your CSVs/Excel files)
2. `notebooks/` (for Python scripts)
3. `queries/` (for saving SQL scripts)
4. `drivers/` (place your Selenium WebDrivers here so you don't lose them)

**Good luck with the filtration! You are going to crush it.** 💙
